FileDigger

File Digger is a program that will search recursively through all files within a user's directory for all files ending with the specified extension(s).

How it works:
When running the script, you can specify one or more extensions in arguments. If no arguments are given, the program will ask for them.
Make sure you separate the arguments with space.
The results will be outputted in a file "[ext]_files.results" within a directory named "results" located in the same directory as the script.
Each result file will contain a list will all the paths of the files that were found.
